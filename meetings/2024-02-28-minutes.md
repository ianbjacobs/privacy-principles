## https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/issues/406

Jeffrey: not sure we can do better....

Robin: we can be more formal... however that doesn't help (as will be more complex).

*Jeffrey will work on a PR*

## https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/issues/405

Jeffrey: I feel that we *do* focus on opt out...  The basic idea is that everything should be in context... we do say that... We could ask "what sentences do you think have this problem"?

Nick: Don provided good context here, and I do think there's been an attempt at trying to support in-context opt-in style engagement. so there's a good chance for overlap here and worth asking for more suggestions.

*Jeffrey to engage*

## https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/issues/401

Jeffrey: I replied.. I think we're good here... 

*we agree to put off closing it and seek chris's feedback*

## Wide review
